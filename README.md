# UNLV Path Finder

This C++ application is a path finder for students at UNLV. Given a set of buildings (nodes) and paths between them (edges), along with a stamina budget, it finds a path from the Thomas Beam Engineering Complex (TBE) to the Student Union (SU) that uses less stamina than the budget.

Each edge between buildings consumes a certain amount of stamina. The goal is to find a path from TBE to SU that leaves at least one unit of stamina remaining.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (supporting C++14 or later)
- Make (optional, for using the provided Makefile)
